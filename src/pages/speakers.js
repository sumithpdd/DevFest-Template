                The DevFest 2025 for London is finally here!!

                We are looking for speakers for several tracks which are about Google Technologies. We are also looking for people who would like to lead workshops.

               </p>
            <h4><b>Not sure of what topic to talk about?</b></h4>
            <p>
                Here are some suggestions of technologies you can talk about(AI/ML, Flutter, Cloud/Devops, Mobile, Web ...... etc) we are more interested on the value the community can get from your talk or workshop so do not worry about those topics too much.
            </p>
